Volumes in Docker

You can share volumes between host to container , 
container to container and container to host.

Disadvantages:

Even though container stopped , one can access volumes in different container or local directory.

You can only declare volumes while creating container and shared same time.
You can not create volume using existing container.
you can share one volumes with any number of containers

Volume wont b part of image commit and push to repository


Commands

Step1 : create volume using Dockerfile or while running container
#Using container

Step2 : docker run -it --name container2 --privileged=true --volumes-from container1 image_name /bin/bash

To copy data from container to local machine

docker cp container_name:/path/to/container/volume ./local/file/path
